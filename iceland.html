            Iceland is probably most well-known for all its waterfalls, but my
            favorite has to be Sk贸gafoss. Encased within an indentation of the
            mountain, this vertical valley has one of the best views of the most
            popular waterfall in Iceland, and for good reason. The images you
            see do not do justice to the immense size of this waterfall. Just
            standing near the base of the waterfall you hear the thunderous roar
            of the water while the water mist mercilessly drenches you from the
            top to bottom. Standing right in front of the waterfall could make
            you feel its majesty, and also make you realize just how
            insignificantly small you are in this universe. Truly a breathtaking
            view.

        `There is a place in Iceland that feels most fantasy-like and so
        departed from reality, and that is Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach. The
        dark sand along with unnatural outside patterns, this place gives you
        a feeling of surrealism. I still remember running my hands through the
        sand and telling myself no matter where I go there is always something
        new that I would have never imagined seeing. Along the beach, if you
        walk further beyond the main area, you would see sem-spherical caves
        lined with the unique hexagonal shapes making it a perfect place to
        take pictures outside of this world.`,
        `The best place to end the trip has to be the Blue Lagoon, which is one
        of the largest volcanic hot baths you can find in the world. With the
        strong smell of sulfur and other minerals, this is a place of
        relaxation. Even during the winter, I am involved in the feeling of
        warmth in this pool. If you walk around the pool, you would be able to
        find a bar that served many beverages. There is also a mud-mask booth,
        where they give you different types of mud masks either free of charge
        or at a premium price. Then I ended the day by eating dinner in one of
        their lavish restaurants. I left the place feeling light and fresh,
        and completely satisfied with my experience here in Iceland.`,
