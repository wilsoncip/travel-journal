          One place you can't miss here is the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park.
          This place is close to the city of Vancouver and is one of the many
          places that you should visit while you are in the British Columbia
          province. It is one of the longest suspension bridges you can find in
          the world. As someone who has the fear of falling, walking down the
          bridge was truly a frightening experience. Although the bridge looks
          very short and meager from a distance, that impression is flipped
          completely upside down once you stand right in the middle of this
          bridge. The strong winds carried through this valley make the bridge
          sway so hard you'd feel like it could flip at any time. It doesn't
          help that many people are walking down the bridge making the sway even
          stronger. A once a lifetime experience.

        `If you are looking to trek/hike, Lynn Canyon Park would be my
        suggestion. It is a very long trail that goes through a dense forest
        that gives you many different views just in one journey. The trail
        runs along the canyon, so you can never miss the river that flows
        through the entire forest. If you want to feel connected with nature
        away from bustling city life, this is the palace you want to be in.
        Just be careful of the bears though.`,
        `Finally, near the town of Banff is the renowned Lake Lousie, with one
        of the most breathtaking views in Canada. Next to the lake is the
        Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise Hotel, where travelers including me can
        reside to enjoy this view. Along the lake is a trail where you get to
        enjoy this huge lake in all its glory. If you walk down the lakeside
        trail, you will find that it continues into the forest, which in its
        own right was also very beautiful. I was told that if you come during
        winter, the entire lake would be frozen, and many people can ice skate
        here if you do enjoy that kind of sport. A palace that you should miss
        if you are in the British Columbia.`,
