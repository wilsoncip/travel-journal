          <h2>Streets of Higashiyama, Kyoto</h2>
          <p>
            Among all the different cities in Japan, Kyoto has to be one of the
            prettiest. Among many of its cultural heritages, Kyoto leaves a
            completely different feel when compared to the capital. The area I
            found myself most mesmerized by is the Higashiyama district, also
            known as old Kyoto. Many of the buildings here have been standing
            for decades, and still, preserve the atmosphere of the feudal era.
            Walking through the small alleyways, I found myself seeing a lot of
            people wearing yukatas (the traditional Japanese attire worn in
            summer). I was also wearing my yukata, which can be found commonly
            in rental areas around Kyoto. Some many traditional shops and
            restaurants made it feel very cozy yet ironically still very lively.
            I went from shop to shop buying a multitude of traditional Japanese
            snacks like taiyaki and bean-based treats while also grabbing a few
            souvenirs along the way. It just takes you several years in the
            past, an experience rarely felt in our 21st century.

        `Tokyo is a huge city, and there are many districts each with its
        personality. Among famous places like the bustling Shibuya crossing or
        the nightlife of the Shinjuku area, I found Akihabara to be the most
        memorable place for me. This part of Tokyo is always bustling with
        life, similar to what Times square feels like in New York City, but
        with Japanese qualities. This area, known for its Otaku and pop
        culture, contains many stores and entertainment from much different
        anime and manga. As an anime enjoyer, this place was highly enjoyable
        for me, as I brush past shops selling figurines and merchandise.
        Furthermore, there were many arcades through the streets, which had
        plenty of claw machines that I could never win. Luckily for me, I did
        win a prize right before I ended my day here in Akihabara.`,
        `I'd say you have not been to Osaka if you didn't go through Dotonburi
        Area. This district is called the heart of Osaka and is an experience
        you should never miss. The streets are littered with a huge variety of
        restaurants and the buildings are covered in beautiful neon lights
        along with the famous Glico Man. My day spent in Dotonbori left me so
        full that walking home felt like a chore. The bottom line, the food
        here is delicious. It is the best place to try different kinds of
        Japanese food, and also stores that allow you to bring home Japanese
        snacks for yourself. My favorite food to eat here was takoyaki, as the
        cold winter made the hot squid ball taste even better. Though I burnt
        my tongue right after eating my first bite, left me with sore taste
        buds for the rest of my time in Dotonbori.`,
